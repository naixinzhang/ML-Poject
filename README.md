This is a course project for AAE 772 Machine Learning for economics, I first do it with R with my partner using the school knowlege, which is in the pdf file.
Then I deal using the same dataset doing data analysis including data visualization using the knowleadge learnt from kaggle, mainly dealth the data imbalalance issue, using some boosting method to re-do predicting.
